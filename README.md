This is the Convertigo SDK Javascript Core

Convertigo Client SDK is a set of libraries used by mobile or Windows desktop applications to access Convertigo Server services. An application using the SDK can easily access Convertigo services such as Sequences and Transactions.

The Client SDK will abstract the programmer from handling the communication protocols, local cache, FullSync off line data managment, UI thread management and remote logging. So the developer can focus on building the application.

Client SDK is available for:
* [Android Native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-android) apps as a standard Gradle dependency
* [iOS native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-ios) apps as a standard Cocoapod
* Windows desktop or Xamarin apps as Nugets or Xamarin Components
* [Google Angular framework](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-angular) as an NPM package
* [Vue.js](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-vuejs) Framework as an NPM package

This current package is the core of Angular Framework SDK and Vue.js Framework SDK.
